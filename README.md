# UDUBCoursework

The following list is here to showcase the coursework I have done in my Applied and Computational Mathematics Master's Degree at University of Washington.

### Some Notes
The primary purpose for these to be uploaded is to showcase my work to future employers, researchers I may work with, or potential graduate schools. This may also be used as a guide to help study for examinations or to observe practice problems. However, these solutions should not be solely copied to finish a homework assignment. Once again, please do not blindly copy my solutions. If you are to use my work, please cite my work appropritely, and please maintain academic honesty and integrity. Not all my homework assignments will be posted here. To maintain integrity of examinations, those will obviously not be posted on this repository. Additionally, exam performance is not what I am trying to showcase, so that is another reason why exams won't be on here. I will also not be posting AMATH 581: Scientific Computing as that class solely utilizes code which does not showcase what I am trying to showcase. While I strive to ensure that the material posted here is accurate and reflects my best work, there may occasionally be errors; my intention is to primarily include solutions that are completely correct or very close to that. I will most of the time, but not necessarily all of the time put README files in order to indicate where an error or errors occurs or occur.

### UW Grading Guide
University of Washington utilizes a grading scale that might not be super intuitive. My lowest grade a 3.5 scales to an A- for reference. For better reference, please view the Standard Grading System at [UW Grading System](https://www.washington.edu/students/gencat/front/Grading_Sys.html).
