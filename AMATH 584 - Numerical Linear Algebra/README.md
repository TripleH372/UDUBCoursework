A quick note here: I do my best to label exercises to the best of my ability. This may not always transfer over when code is utilized. However, there may be a comment on such code or you may have to scroll down to see what is being discussed.

Additionally, the book we are using is NUMERICAL LINEAR ALGEBRA by Lloyd N Trefethen and David Bau.
